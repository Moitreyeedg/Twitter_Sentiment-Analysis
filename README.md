# Twitter_Sentiment-Analysis
I have picked up a very recent and controversial social issue in India created by a movie “Padmavat” - Initially name “Padmavati”. The movie created an immense controversy related to nation’s historical character “Padmavati”, a legendary Rajput Queen from Western region of India.
"Tweet_scrapping.csv" has all the data required for this challenge. we scrapped using query serch '#Padmavat" using Twitter' Official API. This has a limitation that more than week's old tweet can't be extracted.
Therefore, we are using 5k+ tweets for the prototype model while working on the big data set already scrapped and saved as *.csv for later use.
