# Twitter_Sentiment-Analysis
I have picked up a very recent and controversial social issue in India created by a movie “Padmavat” - Initially name “Padmavati”. The movie created an immense controversy related to nation’s historical character “Padmavati”, a legendary Rajput Queen from Western region of India.
"Tweet_padmavat.csv" has all the data required for this challenge. we scrapped using query serch '#Padmavat" using Twitter' Official API. This has a limitation that more than week's old tweet can't be extracted.
Therefore, we have scrapped a thousand tweets for the prototype model while working on the big data set already scrapped using Python and saved as Tweet.csv for later use.

Files :
1. credentials.txt holds :
  CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_SECRET
  
2. "Tweet_padmavat.csv" holds all the data we scrapped.
3. Tweet.csv (4.5 MB), more than 20k tweets from july,2017 till date.
